I promise to not really use these for my testing insofar that is possible so that demo users can use the tool.

{dissolve} [position:0.75,0.75]Feel free to edit the script I've included here to make things more interesting and test out your own videos. There are a few examples of syntax scattered through these notebooks. Feel free to make things as wacky and weird as you like. Or just run the given script. If you want to learn more about the script syntax, just go to the syntax file, or the example jupyter notebook.

I'm your instructor, Lenny McTwisties. I hope everyone had a good weekend and has come back refreshed and ready to learn! Alright, let's get to it!

Let's get started with our snippet of computer history. These computers right here are called UNIVACS. Very expensive. In 1954 there were only 4 of them in operation but they were crucial in the places where it was used, which can be seen here on the left. Univac stands for UNIversal Automatic Computer. Despite only holding 1,000 words in its memory, the UNIVAC was used for important census-related calculations and even helped man land on the moon.
