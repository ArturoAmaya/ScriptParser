Ok so hardware high bitrate is SO fast, but it is also so big (it's the top series of squares in file size and bottom line of time taken by a solid margin)

Hardware low bitrate does decent, but it's visually noticeably worse

Software Multithread 16 threads does the same as default for file size, but takes marginally more time than the default.

Multithread 30 has the same file sizes as HW low bitrate, but takes way too much time in comparison.

Default seems to be the best combo of size and speed which is disappointing to say the least. It takes about two hours to make a 50 minute video on an M2 Pro chip which is top of the line (albeit a bit old). That's crazy
