Hello the whole sequence of long run temo took 1:34, about 1:20-1:22 of that 
time was just getting the videos from heygen.

I can speed up all the intermediate file writing by using the HW, but the individual 
clips are pretty short so I don't know if it's worth it.

I can definitely multithread the get avatar clips function so they wait for 200 seconds in 
parallel rather than in sequence
