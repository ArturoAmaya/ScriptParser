Hello the whole sequence of long run temo took 1:34, about 1:20-1:22 of that 
time was just getting the videos from heygen.

I can speed up all the intermediate file writing by using the HW, but the individual 
clips are pretty short so I don't know if it's worth it.

I can definitely multithread the get avatar clips function so they wait for 200 seconds in 
parallel rather than in sequence

So I ran the test with the high bitrate version on all output functions ended in a 1:03 total runtime
The file is indeed larger, 160 MB to the previous 137 MB.

Whether or not that is worth it seems to be up to the user. 
I don't particularly think it's worth it unless you're making a 2 hours-long video.
The aggregate sum of the total disk space used by all the intermediate files is interesting though.
We can compare:

The gpu only on longrun folder has a total size of 233 MB
The gpu always folder has a total size of 1.2 GB

And that's without considering the temp files used to make up the final video pre-sw
Apparently this didn't use any but either way the final file was 1.12 GB, which is presumably larger than before.

So we're talking at least 800 MB larger total size for this run, which is not too bad.
It is however, at least 5x the size of the other one, at LEAST.

Would be interesting to see what happens without it and repeated lots of times. Let's run that
