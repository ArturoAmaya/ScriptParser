Hello, my name is Ahrtuhroh. This is really silly but I really like unicycles. Not the regular unicycles, special unicycles that you ride like a skateboard. I ride them all them time. They are called one wheels. I hope I don't sound kind of silly saying this but they are so cool.

I wish chatgpt could give me script but I am opposed in principle. That is ironic given that I am doing work to aid a generative AI company. This work is pretty cool. I like making videos dynamically, and I have an idea for a random video generator. 

In the meantime, I do this. They're just dedicated like that. I'm not dedicated like that. I'm just kidding. Laura says that Chancellor Khosla is pretty cool. I'm pretty sure this slide includes his head. Maybe. Darren agrees!

I really like powerberries. I did this in French this morning and I don't think it went particularly well. Sad face. She is so strict. But she did bring in meringues. Because it was her birthday. Happy days, madame.

This next slide is about quantum mechanics. Quantum means quantumania, like Ant Man. Mechanics means they build cars. In sum, quantum mechanics is about shrinking cars. I can't believe that writing stuff like this counts as productive time. It is wonderful. Thank you so much for coming to my fake email-funded API testing. Now you can show yourself out. Angry face.
